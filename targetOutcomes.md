For this article you should focus on the findings for Experiment 1 reported in section 2.2. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> 2.2. Results & discussion

> Data from one participant was excluded from the analysis because they performed below chance (50%) on this task. For the remaining 39 participants, inducer identification accuracy was high (96% for the small inducers and 97% for the large inducers).

> Target identification accuracy data for the remaining 39 participants were submitted to a 2 (attended-region-size: small versus large) × 2 (mask offset condition: simultaneous versus delayed) repeated-measures ANOVA. This revealed a significant main effect of attended-region size, F(1, 38) = 12.10, p = 0.001, ηp2 = 0.241, such that accuracy was higher in the small size versus large condition. This demonstrates that the manipulation of attended-region size was successful. There was a significant main effect of mask-offset condition, F(1, 38) = 15.36, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.288, whereby target identification was greater on the simultaneous than on the delayed mask-offset trials. This demonstrates the presence of OSM. However, there was no reliable interaction between attended-region-size and mask-offset condition, F(1, 38) = 0.48, p = 0.494, ηp2 = 0.012. This tells us that the effect of mask offset condition on target identification was unchanged by attended-region size. The absence of an interaction between the two factors of attended-region size and mask-offset condition, which had reliably main effects in their own right, suggests that attended-region size does not affect OSM (see Fig. 5).
